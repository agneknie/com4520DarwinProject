head hunter
piece of cake
cutting edge
night owl
gold mine
brass ring
big fish
elbow room
guinea pig
wet blanket
swan song
pull yourself together
once in a blue moon
stabbed in the back
takes two to tango
kill two birds with one stone
costs an arm and a leg
break a leg
rule of thumb
blow off some steam
by the skin of your teeth
miss the boat
hit the sack
see eye to eye
jump on the bandwagon
you can say that again
as right as rain
wild goose chase
beat around the bush
fish in a barrel
all bark and no teeth
pardon my french
cat got your tongue
chew the fat
under the weather
break the ice
bury the hatchet
turn a blind eye
barking up the wrong tree
pull some strings
