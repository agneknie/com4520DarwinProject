"” Yang Kai smiled coldly, “You and I are the only ones left here, Sang De, so let’s not beat around the bush."
"We have been friends for a long time, you don’t have to beat around the bush”."
"Not wanting to beat around the bush with them, Yang Kai bluntly asked, “May I know the purpose of your visit?"

back against the wall
------------------------------------
"All five disciples were knocked back against the wall, bleeding from their seven orifices."
He leaned his back against the wall and buried his face in his hands.
” The man gracefully leaned his back against the wall and imitated Youyou’s manner of speaking.
"Feeling jittery in fear, she shakily leaned her back against the wall."
"Instead, he lay down in the cockpit with his back against the wall, curled up and fell asleep quickly."
He had his back against the wall as he opened his third eye and spotted the white-haired youth in the illusory formation.
"He avoided another sword strike and went in for a punch, slamming Tianming back against the wall of the cauldron."
"Cursing Belius' array which prevented her to access to the civilian amulet that she had forgotten inside her dimensional ring, Kamila put her back against the wall while checking her surroundings."

"Otherwise, how could I make that renowned Duan Jidao run around in circles on my palm?"
"Nevertheless, Yang Kai and Qian Tong were exhausted from being run around in circles."
------------------------------------
on cloud nine
------------------------------------
"” Gu Lingbo, as well as the other Patriarchs, and Sovereigns quickly replied, then they all left the inner hall in light steps, as if walking on cloud nine."
"Hearing the Ascending Moon Old Man agree, this Alchemist Grandmaster Association Chief was on cloud nine, it clearly showed in his speech and demeanor."
His heart pounded in his chest like he was floating on cloud nine.
He felt as though he was floating on cloud nine.
"Should it be other women in her place now, they would likely be on cloud nine."
"Yun Shishi, meanwhile, could not help feeling relatively smug with herself and was up on cloud nine when she heard the retail staff singing praises about her good taste."
"Meng Qingxue, who was practically on cloud nine by then, felt somewhat incredulous."
Ouyang Jianwang was on cloud nine; he had never experienced anything this thrilling.
She felt like she was still on cloud nine.
Solus felt on cloud nine.

"How could he have anticipated being left out in the cold, not even allowed through the front gates."
"Meanwhile, Xiao Yu realized that the young man beside him had been left out in the cold, so he hurriedly introduced him."

"“Naturally, these insects have many benefits, and by using them to control even a few Monstrous Beasts, we can then create a snowball effect, easily capturing more Monstrous Beasts, and if we meet any of your Great Han Dynasty cultivators, we don’t even need to lift a finger in order to take their lives."
The medicines he refined would then become his way of making money and the starting point for creating a snowball effect.
------------------------------------
"in for a penny, in for a pound"
------------------------------------
"After a while, in for a penny, in for a pounding I say [AN: freely translated from kinky Mogarian]”."
"At this point, Bai Yun Feng was in for a penny, in for a pound, refusing to give Yang Kai any room to breathe, his stature flashed like the wind, rushed forward."
"On the way here, Yang Kai had told her that Yao He and Yao Xi would most likely go in for a penny, in for a pound and act ruthlessly."
"Now in for a penny, in for a pound, Yang Kai gathered all of his Spiritual Energy into the small sword Soul type artifact in his Knowledge Sea, transforming it into a fiery red ray of light that shot towards the man’s forehead."
"As the saying went, ‘in for a penny, in for a pound’."

fair and square
------------------------------------
"If you are somewhat capable, come and fight me fair and square with your own strength!"
"If things were to be divided fair and square amongst the nine super forces, each force would be getting four oblasts."
"If you have the ability, go defeat Huang Xiaolong fair and square."
Defeat Huang Xiaolong fair and square?
"In that case, he will defeat Huang Xiaolong fair and square!"
"Although Huang Xiaolong was the Institute Principal’s personal disciple, no one could find fault with his action, for he would defeat Huang Xiaolong fair and square on the arena stage."
"The bet that time was fair and square, yet it suddenly turned into Huang Xiaolong using an underhanded method to win the bet!"
"Zhu Heng went on, “If you want it, come to the New Stone World, make a fair and square bet with me."
"Xing Tian stared at Chen Weijian, and he paused for a moment before saying, “Even though I really want the Devil Holy Water, someone has already bought it fair and square."
"Make him take the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures out, and after you kill him, you will be able to obtain the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures fair and square”."
"However, I did it fair and square, openly and honorably; unlike you."
"Zhao Xuanhe, you lost fair and square,” the Sagacious Grandmaster said."
I dare you to dispel this formation and face us fair and square!
"After all, I did win that fair and square through the Niantian Gambling Formation,” Chu Feng said."
"Then, he turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, you might have defeated my older brother today, but you didn’t win fair and square."
"I won it fair and square, so it is rightfully mine."
We’ll help you handle this matter fair and square!
We won fair and square based on our skills.
"After that, we can settle things fair and square""."
"I broke the golem formation of that black dragon myself and got it fair and square, so it wasn't yours to begin with."
You have won fair and square.
"They wouldn't even have to hear them out now, as they had won the divine herb fair and square."
Let’s have a fair and square fight.
"After that, although their circumstances are somewhat similar, Sirius, who is a proud knight who fights fair and square, and Rasal, who is the complete opposite and thinks that winning easily, even by using cowardly means, is justice, were like cats and dogs, fighting with each other almost every day."
We fought each other fair and square.
"You’ve been fighting cowardly since a while ago, fight me fair and square!"
He had never meant to take over Laruel by fighting her fair and square.
"""You are going to face Verhen fair and square."
"These Iron Bone Grasses are what they wagered in that fight, it’s not like we robbed them or something, we won them fair and square!"
"In front of Yang Kai, who had defeated him fair and square in an Alchemy competition, Ji Ying could not bring himself to be proud of his achievements."
"[It wasn’t lies and trickery, Yang Kai won fair and square with his Alchemy skills."
------------------------------------
a black sheep
------------------------------------
"“Elder, Gu Yang is a black sheep in the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan."
“How did a black sheep like you appear in our Situ World Spiritist Clan?
"Kigan, instead, was a black sheep of his family."
------------------------------------
bear a grudge
------------------------------------
"As for that Zhou Wenting, whether she would bear a grudge toward him or not, he didn’t mind in the slightest."
"Thus, Brother Chu Feng, you must, by all means, not take offense from this,” Yan Lei feared that Chu Feng would bear a grudge, and so began to explain to him why he had not invited the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain."
I’m not so petty as to bear a grudge against a man who saved my woman’s life!
It would be hypocritical to say that he did not bear a grudge.
"They didn't even bear a grudge against him and only knew what he looked like, but that hadn’t earned them Tianming's mercy and he killed them all the same."
"If there was no Yin Yang Joyous Unification Art, he could only feel that Su Yan would bear a grudge against him for seizing her virginity."
"Even if she didn’t bear a grudge, she wouldn’t have a favourable impression of him, so how could there be mutual affinity between them?"
"Sun Yu became slightly nervous and asked, “Senior Yang, although I can now have peace of mind, afterwards, will Palace Master and the others bear a grudge towards me?"
"” Yang Kai looked at them and laughed, pausing for a moment before nodding, “Go, tell your master what I told you: If she dares bear a grudge against me while biding her time to seek revenge, I will not let her off!"
"I hope you can assist the Young Master with all your heart in the future and not bear a grudge against this old master,” Qin Wu Hui said sincerely."
Those who would bear a grudge would surely bear a grudge against the people from these two Sects.
"On the other hand, those twenty-nine Monster Kings would bear a grudge against her forever if she refused his request today."
It wasn’t a good idea to have a Demon Saint bear a grudge against him.
He didn’t dare bear a grudge against Zhao Lin.

"“Lin Xueya, you’d better know where to draw the line!"
"I’ve had numerous flings out there, but I know where to draw the line!"

"The old man calmly responded, “It’s easier said than done to take away a supreme treasure like the blood moon!"

Some things are much easier said than done.
Chu Feng couldn’t help but recall the Burning Heaven Church’s fate and Tantai Xue’s words: some things were easier said than done.
"However, obtaining the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl was easier said than done."
But that was easier said than done.
"It’s just that it’s easier said than done, and there’s a chance that you might lose your life if you fail,” Yao Cheng said."

“It’s easier said than done.
"However, it is often easier said than done."
"Brat, things are easier said than done."

"Lin Zhiren, Yu Chen, and the Big Sword Sect Elders were flopping like fish out of water under the pressure."
"Observing the man flapping like a fish out of water, an idea struck Huang Xiaolong like a bolt of lightning."
"Lu Jing grasped at his throat, mouth opened like a fish out of water, red in the face."

"Facing these three incredibly powerful experts, even Long Chen felt like he was walking on thin ice."

"Furthermore, there were several moments where I was treading on thin ice last time, but they are much easier now."
"Since he had mixed in with the Red Cloud Sect, Yang Kai had to remain cautious, always walking on thin ice until now."

"In order to stop the insect king from completely draining his stored Yuan Qi and then consuming his flesh and blood, Yang Kai quickly circulated his True Yang Secret Art, pouring the True Yang Yuan Qi from his meridians into the Star Chart Space."
"In the past, when it acquired its victims, the first thing it would do was swallow the various energies stored within them, after swallowing that clean, it would move on to the flesh and blood."
"“This kind of ancient insect can swallow anything, it especially likes to devour a variety of energy and flesh and blood, and contained within every Heaven Devouring Insect’s body there is some kind of opportunity, if someone can refine it, they can acquire great benefits."
"These two Monster Beast phantoms were extremely lifelike, like flesh and blood living beings."
"Once he was a powerful old devil, but now he had been reduced to only a residual Soul without a flesh and blood body, usually he could leisurely reside within his Soul Breaker Awl, but falling into this strange mist shrouded place was like falling into hell, causing him unimaginable torment and pain, much greater than either Yang Kai and Chi Xue."
"His flesh and blood festered as it melted, and soon only bleached bones were left behind."
"The two warriors no doubt were as close as any flesh and blood brother and sister, yet because of a casual order, they had been forced to exchange blows."
"As more cultivators were swallowed up by the green gas and melted into puddles of flesh and blood, many chose to retreat and, like Ji Yan, flew up into the sky."
"However, Yang Kai actually paid no attention to this marvellous sight, his entire mind completely immersed in studying his Demon Crests, trying to integrate them into his body, causing his flesh and blood to tremble."
"Not only that, the his flesh and blood around his shoulder blades began throbbing intensely, as if something was trying to break free from them."
"Devastating energy surrounded Yang Kai, tearing his clothes to shreds and ripping apart his flesh and blood."
"The powerful medicinal properties in these raw herbs, combined with his own enhanced Blood Force after the Demon God Transformation allowed Yang Kai’s damaged body to rapidly be repaired, but as quickly as his flesh and blood were restored, they were again torn apart by the Starry Sky Storm."
"Although he couldn’t see what he looked like right now, Yang Kai knew his appearance must be miserable because he could tell that much of his flesh and blood was missing."
"Broken tendons connected together and become tougher and more flexible while his flesh and blood were slowly regenerated, stronger than ever before."
"Right now, Yang Kai’s entire physique was no covered in a faint golden aura, even his damaged five viscera and six organs were giving off a golden glow as a staggering vitality gradually rebuilding his flesh and blood."
"As his flesh and blood squirmed and regenerated, impurities Yang Kai never knew existed slowly began discharging from his body, purifying his physique while increasing its formidability."
"Cracking his bones as he inspected himself, Yang Kai quickly noticed the various changes his flesh and blood had undergone."
"No one knows how they were born, but these strange life forms normally possess strong vitality and odd physiques that grant them more powerful strength than mere flesh and blood”."
"“En, they don’t innately possess flesh and blood, only a skeleton and meridians, but among them there are masters of exceedingly high strength."
"Since they didn’t possess their flesh and blood bodies here and couldn’t use any of their respective Martial Skills or artifacts, the only thing anyone here could use to attack another was Soul Skills!"
"Without artifacts, Martial Skills, or even flesh and blood, the only thing everyone could rely on was their own Soul’s strength and any Soul Skills they may have cultivated."
His flesh and blood pulsed with unimaginable power.
"Yang Kai did the complete opposite of this, using his tyrannical physique to directly withstand this external bombardment, tempering his flesh and blood to the extreme, forming a never ending cycle of benefits."
"” The masters from Frozen Nether Cave Heaven stared dumbly towards the scattered flesh and blood falling down from above, all of them instantly becoming absent-minded, as if they were unable to accept such a result."
"This was still a type of True Qi transformation, but it was simply too real, essentially no different from a flesh and blood Monster Beast."
"So, Yang Kai thought, if he now stayed here and felt the mysteries hidden inside this Void Storm with his own flesh and blood, perhaps he could unlock the secrets of tearing space which had thus far eluded him!"
"“Sorry,” Yang Kai apologized, “I can’t bring anything with flesh and blood into this place or I would find a few companions for you… En, there actually used to be a Yin Yang Monster Ginseng here but it disappeared many years ago”."
"Everyone looked in the direction he pointed and saw a broken corpse with a great deal of flesh and blood, as if it had been chopped into a million pieces, scattered about inside one of the turbulent flows."
"The storm of World Energy continued to fall and it was not long before blood began leaking from the side of Li Rong’s mouth, her tender body shuddering, seemingly somewhat unable to bear this pressure but still gritting her teeth and steadfastly enduring in order to allow her flesh and blood to absorb as much of this baptism as possible and convert it into her own strength."
"The violent power of the spear tore this disciple’s body apart, splattered his flesh and blood all over while also sending out a wave of destructive energy."
"The Third-Order Transcendent Realm young had actually used his flesh and blood body to not only block his artifact’s all-out attack but even forcefully repelled it, sending Chou Xu flying."
"That frozen skeleton was exactly the same as the humanoid one in front them, without any flesh and blood, only consisting of bones and meridians, a frightening sight to behold."
"All around, there were tragically killed cultivators, and at this moment, an inexplicable attraction was being emitted from the skeleton, causing the flesh and blood of the dead bodies to transform into a stream of energy and flow into it."
"After absorbing the flesh and blood of these dead people, a thin layer of flesh appeared on the surface of the skeleton."
"From all around, the flesh and blood of the deceased cultivators transformed into stream of pure vitality and poured into the Bone Race’s skeleton."
It seemed like her Water Spirit Body would allow them to more quickly restore themselves than the flesh and blood of ordinary cultivators.
"On top of that, after they killed someone, they would absorb their flesh and blood to restore themselves and to mould their own physique."
"Ke Luo laughed and replied, “As long as we kill enough experts and obtain enough high-grade flesh and blood as well as the matching high-grade herbs, what’s so difficult about creating Saints?"
"The worst part though was that by collecting raw flesh and blood, and mixing them with a variety of herbs, they could create more of their own race!"
"“Holy Master, you mean to say that these Bone Race creatures are only living skeletons but they can actually absorb the flesh and blood of others to mould their own physiques?"
“And they can create more of their race from a large amount of dead cultivator’s flesh and blood along with the appropriate herbs?
"When he heard about the great change in the world and the recovery of the Bone Race, Old Demon’s expression suddenly becomes very strange, solemnly asking, “Young Master, are these Bone Race people you speak of nothing more than skeletons, but also capable of absorbing the flesh and blood of fallen masters to shape their own physique?"
"A golden glowing man flew rapidly through the Starry Sky, his eyes firm and resolute, his body strong, and his expression indifferent; he was not using any kind of artifact, nor was he circulating his strength to shield himself, using only his flesh and blood body to resist the pressure of the Starry Sky as he roamed freely."
Yang Kai said that the Bone Race has the dozens of Saint Realm masters among them and that they can use the flesh and blood of masters they kill to create more of themselves.
"All the Bone Race, Human, Demon, and Monster Race masters who died on this battlefield had their flesh and blood transformed into vital essence which then invisibly sank into the ground before gathering towards a certain spot where a formidable aura was concealing itself."
"As his flesh and blood flew apart, Ke Luo suddenly came to a halt."
"The most sorrowful aspect of the aftermath though was that those who had died had been stripped of all their flesh and blood, leaving behind only bleached bones."
"Subsequently, their flesh and blood bodies would be eaten away by the specters until nothing of them remained."
"No matter how he pushed his own strength, he was unable to extinguish the Demonic Flames eating away at his body, instead only making things worse as the black flames seemed capable of burning everything it was fed, whether it was his clothing, his flesh and blood, or even his Saint Qi, all of it was just fuel to the Demonic Flames."
"From the appearance of the skeleton, it was clear it belonged to a bird type Monster Beast but all its flesh and blood had long ago disappeared and its Monster Core was nowhere to be seen."
"Black Rock Beasts only fed on minerals and ores, not flesh and blood."
Its flesh and blood had crystallized into this tree and streaks of lightly now flashed across its surface.
A bloody smell rose as chunks of flesh and blood splattered everywhere.
It can grow infinitely as long as it’s supplied with enough flesh and blood.
"Yet now, this severed arm had somehow grown back, and judging from the colour and aura fluctuations, this new arm wasn’t some kind of prosthesis or artifact, it was clearly a flesh and blood arm!"
"The broken remains of these six splashed out across the ground, but a moment later their flesh and blood was absorbed by these plants."
"A skeleton, still assuming a defensive posture, stood mid-air, all its flesh and blood stripped away clean."
"The giant dark-green dragon transformed artifact looked almost as if it had a true flesh and blood body, as though a true Ancient Divine Spirit had suddenly appeared in this place, making her not dare to underestimate it."
"In his territory, if there were traces of any humans, his children would follow his doctrine and kill all humans on sight, partaking of their flesh and blood."
The toughness of Yang Kai’s physical body made Xue Lian feel like it was forged from the strongest steel rather than flesh and blood.
"Without using any kind of defensive artifact, and only circulating his Saint Qi to the minimum required level, Yang Kai used his flesh and blood body as well as his Shi to resist this Domain Vortex, allowing him to feel its mysteries in the most unobstructed manner possible."
"Yang Kai not only used his Shi, but also his own flesh and blood."
"However, the sounds of flesh and blood being torn asunder and flying out never came, stunning Xue Sun."
"With a resounding crack, Mi Tian’s body was crushed, his flesh and blood spattering out!"
"The pure white phantom floating above her head felt like her own flesh and blood, merging perfectly with her form."
"Soon, flesh and blood creatures were also born."
"The battle raged on, with fists meeting flesh and blood constantly splashing out."
Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he secretly looked forward to a scene of splattered flesh and blood.
"According to Yang Kai’s observations, as long as it was a flesh and blood living creature, once it was contaminated by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light, the consequences would be disastrous."
"The Stone Puppet’s physique was not composed of flesh and blood, so it should not be affected by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light."
"Although he could not recognize what the Stone Puppet was, Zi Dong could tell that it did not have a flesh and blood body, so it shouldn’t be a problem for it to enter the Seven Coloured Radiant Light; and if that was the case, could Yang Kai really obtain the remaining Heavenly Infant Grass?"
"The Seven Coloured Radiant Light ignored all forms of defence, not by aiming at a physical body but at the existence of flesh and blood, so the Stone Puppet’s physique was not restrained by it."
"Since this puppet was not refined from flesh and blood, it shouldn’t fear the terrifying Seven Coloured Radiant Light, which made it the best way to enter the barrier and extract the Immortal Source Liquid."
"Yang Kai frowned as he glanced down at the scattered flesh and blood, then at Lie Kong’s miserable condition, saying with a calm tone, “Seems I came a bit late!"
"Li Nuo sighed, “The President is too cruel, sending his own flesh and blood to this place."
"In this world, not all creatures required a flesh and blood body to be considered alive and sentient."
"Because, even though it looked like it was made of pure fire, it was still obviously a flesh and blood creature, and... Yang Kai also vaguely felt a faint pressure from it, a sign that it was likely even stronger than he was."
"Because it wasn't a body of flesh and blood, Yang Kai was unable to sense the vitality of the Embodiment."
"Even though Yang Kai had a strong and robust physical body, how could he withstand the bombardment of a continent with a body of flesh and blood?"
"Not only that, the barrier that blocked the two of them contained an extremely brutal killing power, directly wringing the two into a mass of flesh and blood, exploding in the air."
"Although she seemed like a flesh and blood being, she still had a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation level."
"Even more horrifying was that Yang Kai’s finger, made of flesh and blood, was completely unharmed despite it clashing with a sword artifact."
"But, if one observed it with their Divine Sense, they would realize that this bird didn’t have a body of flesh and blood and it was just a puppet crafted out of various materials."
"A thick bloody smell hung in the air, while the word ‘Death’, written using flesh and blood, was present on the wall, a sight that would shock anyone who saw it."
"Yang Kai held it like he was holding a living creature with real flesh and blood, as its vitality was shockingly strong."
"Their flesh and blood withered away, but their skeletons remained here."
"Normally, the Blood Gate couldn’t be approached at all, and even the strongest Monster Kings would be reduced to nothing but a gory puddle of flesh and blood by its mysterious power once they tried, leaving not even a corpse behind."
"As she stared at the gore-filled pool of flesh and blood and remembers that this puddle used to be a man who had committed all kinds of perverted acts to her just moments ago, the woman immediately turned pale and flew to the side, emptying her stomach of all its content, vomiting so hard that everything went black before her eyes for a while."
Wild Force pervaded the air and seemed capable of corroding any living being composed of flesh and blood.
"He braved the harsh cold winds and walked through the mud mixed with the flesh and blood of those strange monsters, racing into the herd of beasts in the blink of an eye."
[It’s the essence of the Monster Beast’s flesh and blood!
This way of refining a Monster Beast’s flesh and blood was much more convenient and rapid than slowly cultivating with ambient World Energy.
"[If the flesh and blood of the Monster Beast can be eaten, then the Monster Core should be okay too, right?"
"The best way to improve his strength would be to find Monster Beasts, obtain their flesh and blood, and retrieve their Monster Cores."
"Although he did not have flesh and blood, Fei Li could still feel the horrifying chill from the depths of his Soul from that time."
"The dust, which was formerly Ku Ke’s flesh and blood, rained down on the ground along with three hearts."
"Sword light swept through everything as several self-confident Demon Great Generals were cleaved in half by Yang Kai, flesh and blood spewing wildly, and the residual force of the Sword Qi clearing out a wide area, crushing all the Demons around into paste."
"There were quite a few of them, as many as five, and the leader among them did not have any flesh and blood but was just a dark and tall skeleton with two constantly flickering ghost fires in his eye sockets."
"Although he had only a skeleton frame instead of flesh and blood, he still felt a throbbing pain in his neck he was unfamiliar with."
"The world had turned into a furnace, with flesh and blood as the coals, and the flames of war burning more and more furiously."
"Wherever the Shaman Niu Clan passed, fellow Ancient Barbarians would surround them from all directions, charging out in front of them, and open a path for the hundred thousand Shaman Niu Clansmen with their own flesh and blood, slaughtering all Demons who blocked their way."
"It should have invaded this Shaman Niu’s body and merged with his flesh and blood, so how did he manage to spit it out again?"
"Although it has a body of flesh and blood, it has no source or root."
Blood spread across the sky like a rose in full bloom while flesh and blood rained down on the ground.
"Although she is a Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit, which does not clash with the attribute of the Phoenix True Fire, she does not have a flesh and blood body."
"[These children are their flesh and blood, regardless of whether they have Dragon Vein or not!"
"Members of the Stone Spirit Clan are born with a body of stone, so the way their emotions or desires manifest are vastly different from those of flesh and blood."
A series of muffled noises rang out as flesh and blood splattered everywhere.
"The sight of flesh and blood flying in all directions… If he had not seen it for himself, it would have been hard for him to imagine just how cruel the conflict between the two races was."
It was much more difficult for plants to become Monsters compared to creatures with flesh and blood bodies.
"Although there were no bones nor body left after the explosion, flesh and blood did not splatter all over the place."
"Almost all of her flesh and blood had been consumed as a result, leading to her current starved and emaciated appearance."
"The reason their bodies were round was because each of them had a fat belly and their bare skin was pitch black, like a rolling mass of evil flesh and blood."
"The Demon Race was just like them, made of flesh and blood."
"The Mid-Rank Demon King and Low-Rank Demon King were almost indistinguishable at this moment as their bodies burst into raining chunks of flesh and blood, dying the ground around them blood red."
"Even saying what she did about women being unable to bear killing their own man, even one’s own flesh and blood could be cut down in the pursuit of the Grand Dao, so what need be said of love between men and women?"
"The sensations a Soul Avatar could feel were much more intense than those of a flesh and blood body, so as he was pinched, Yang Kai was gripped by excruciating pain."
The vast battlefield in the southeast corner was like a huge meat grinder that turned both Humans and Demons into nothing but ground flesh and blood.
It was not a true flesh and blood body at all!

a slap on the wrist

"If Huang Xiaolong was any ordinary Holy Prince, Li Wen might show some mercy and let the Jiang Family off with a slap on the wrist."

black and blue
------------------------------------
"” Within Huang Xiaolong's mind, an inherited memory was transferred to him from the twin black and blue dragon."
"After leaving Huang Clan Manor four months ago, his twin dragon martial spirits had become not just bigger, but the scales of both black and blue dragons’ have become tougher and denser and their claws looked stronger than before."
"As Huang Xiaolong ran his battle qi, one black and one blue dragon’s body slowly coiled together as black and blue light flickered, fusing, and suddenly a glaring light glowed and the fusing was completed successfully into a double-headed dragon instead of a serpent."
"But despite two days’ worth of effort, every time Huang Xiaolong summoned his martial spirits, both the black and blue dragon would appear."
"However, just when these fire dragons got close to them, the black and blue dragon stretched their jaws and devoured all the fire dragons cleanly."
"The twin dragons didn’t stop after devouring the fire dragons that attacked them; they continued onto other fire dragons and one after another, fire dragons of various sizes went into the black and blue dragon’s stomach."
"A short while later, the fire dragons above the sea of fire were swallowed into the black and blue dragon’s stomach till none were left."
"On the surface, the black and blue dragons looked like they were layered with a fiery red glow, rippling along the scales of their body, and the dragons’ natural oppressive aura multiplied."
"When all the fire qi dragons were gone, the black and blue dragons once again circled the pagoda."
"But, around the pagoda was an invisible barrier of fire qi, blocking the black and blue dragons a few meters away, unable to get closer to it."
"Even so, every time the black and blue dragon spun around it, the fire qi barrier would become a little thinner."
"Then, the black and blue dragon wrapped the pagoda with their bodies and headed back towards the stone chamber Huang Xiaolong was in."
"During the entire time, the black and blue dragons were wrapped around the pagoda, swallowing the fire qi that came out from it."
"The black and blue dragons entwined together, and the echoes of the dragons’ roar vibrated in all four directions."
"The black and blue dragons were devouring the spiritual aura with greed; the Linglong Treasure Pagoda also came out, floating above Huang Xiaolong, parallel with the twin dragons."
"The twin dragons’ bodies grew bigger, the black and blue scales became denser, and the most amazing thing was another claw grew out from the initial four, and they both turned into five-clawed dragons."
"After the black and blue dragons evolved, their speed of absorbing the netherworld spiritual energy had become three times faster compared to when he was at peak late-Sixth Order!"
"Calling out both the black and blue dragons, Huang Xiaolong initiated the soul transformation process."
"Instantly, black and blue lights broke out and disappeared in a less than a second, wrapping themselves over Huang Xiaolong’s body, beginning the fusion."
The black and blue dragon behind Huang Xiaolong roared towards the sky; the dragon scales on their body became denser and shinier.
"After swallowing a Fire Dragon Pearl, Huang Xiaolong ran Asura Tactics as the black and blue dragon emerged, hovering above his head."
"The moment Huang Xiaolong’s black and blue twin dragons flew towards the golden circle ring, all the experts in the Enlightenment Lake vicinity could see the brilliant light piercing from the lake below."
"The black and blue dragons entwined around the golden circle ring wanting to return to Huang Xiaolong’s body, but the golden ring suddenly vibrated with a hum, releasing a mysterious energy that repelled the twin dragons."
"Both the black and blue dragons wound around it firmly and returned to Huang Xiaolong’s body, dragging the golden ring along as a prisoner."
Behind him hovered the black and blue twin dragons.
The black and blue twin dragons were hovering behind him as they devoured the netherworld spiritual energy that came gushing down from the void above him.
"The black and blue twin dragons hovering behind him grew bigger, becoming more real and corporeal."
"When Huang Xiaolong entered the Xiantian realm, both of the black and blue dragons would evolve a third time, turning into real solid entities."
"The twin black and blue dragons hovered behind Huang Xiaolong, and the dozen plus meter length of their bodies sparkled as each of the dragon’s scales grew thicker and denser."
"The twin dragon martial spirits behind Huang Xiaolong devoured the spiritual energy greedily, and black and blue lights were scintillating as their primordial divine dragon scales fell off one by one!"
"Running the Asura Tactics cultivation technique, the black and blue dragon emerged behind Huang Xiaolong, hovering above his head as they greedily devoured the netherworld spiritual energy gushing down from the void."
"The twin black and blue dragons floated in mid-air behind Huang Xiaolong, roaring endlessly as their bodies grew bigger and more solid and real among a pulsating glow."
"On the dragons’ bodies, pieces of black and blue scales as thick as armor were growing on the surface, layer after layer."
"Both the black and blue dragon had condensed into a solid entity, emanating the potent aura of the Primordial Divine Dragon race!"
"Getting up, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes focused on the black and blue dragon that was hovering above him, and undisguised excitement showed on his face."
"Stepping into Xiantian realm, the black and blue twin dragons both had grown, surpassing twenty meters in length."
"Looking at the black and blue dragons floating before him, Huang Xiaolong leaped up and his feet landed on top of the black dragon’s head, whereas the blue dragon wrapped around Huang Xiaolong’s body."
"Scales of two colors, black and blue emerged on the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s skin."
Tattoo-like images of a black and blue dragon’s head manifested on Huang Xiaolong’s back as sharp dragon spikes protruded out from Huang Xiaolong’s arms.
"At the same time, the black and blue dragon hovered high above him, devouring the true dragon qi tumbling down from the ancient dragon world."
Huang Xiaolong breathed in and out according to a certain rhythm as black and blue colored lights coruscated.
He immediately summoned his black and blue dragons and soul transformed.
"Fusing with the twin dragon martial spirits, a layer of black and blue dragon scales covered the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s skin."
"As Huang Xiaolong watched, the black and blue dragon martial spirits in his body flew towards the Absolute Soul Pearl."
"Rarely would there be anyone on these routes, so he summoned the black and blue dragons out."
"Before this Buddhism power, a feeling of wanting to prostrate in submission rose in Huang Xiaolong’s mind but at this precise moment, the black and blue dragons in Huang Xiaolong’s body shook, releasing a mighty aura that rushed out of Huang Xiaolong’s body."
"Ever since Duanren Empire’s Imperial City Battle, where Huang Xiaolong exposed his superb talent twin dragon martial spirits, the black and blue dragons, many experts of different empires in Snow Wind Continent had started paying attention to him."
"Without a second thought, a coruscating light shrouded Huang Xiaolong as he summoned out both black and blue twin dragon martial spirits."
"A flurry of ethereal arms appeared on his body, while the black and blue dragons hovered in the void above him, greedily devouring the true dragon qi gushing down from another space."
The black and blue dragons in the void above roared endlessly.
"Before they could say anything, a dazzling black and blue light shot out like lightning from Huang Xiaolong’s body, revealing his twin dragon martial spirits behind him."
"Both the black and blue dragons sucked at the wine urn, drawing strands of dark purple lights from the urn of wine, gathering in the air above, turning into a vague demonic shadow, shrieking shrilly, making everyone shudder."
"The black and blue twin dragons hovered above Huang Xiaolong, faint echoes of dragon roars sounded endlessly and dragon scales shone with a steely glint on their huge bodies."
"Hovering behind Huang Xiaolong, they looked like two daunting mountains of black and blue."
"The black and blue dragons wound themselves around Huang Xiaolong, akin to a Dragon God reincarnation."
"In a dazzling flash of light, he soul transformed with the black and blue dragons."
"Before the stunned faces of Chen Xiaotian and the rest, layers of sturdy black and blue dragon scales grew on the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s skin, covering him like an armor, as two tattoo-like dragon heads appeared on his back."
"A coruscating light of black and blue gushed out, dragon roars thundered in the hall, and before Jiang Tianhua’s astonished eyes, two larger than life dragons emerged, one black and one blue, hovering behind Huang Xiaolong."
Huang Xiaolong soul transformed right after summoning the black and blue dragons.
This was the first time he soul transformed with both the black and blue dragons since he broke through to Xiantian Seventh Order.
"Finally, his soul sea returned to its prior calm, while in the space above his soul sea, the black and blue dragons hovered, dragons roars echoed endlessly, exuding dragon might in every direction."
"Soul transforming with the twin dragon martial spirits, layers of black and blue dragon scales covered Huang Xiaolong like an armor, yet he still felt the frigid cold wind blowing up, invading his body through the dragon scales."
"Breaking through Xiantian Ninth Order, the black and blue dragons reached the size of a hundred zhang in length, seemingly covering heaven and earth."
"In the end, Huang Xiaolong soul transformed with both black and blue dragon martial spirits, striking out at full force at the tree trunk."
"The black and blue dragons hovered above Huang Xiaolong’s head, roaring with excitement."
"For the black and blue twin dragon martial spirits, the dragon essence from the egg was, without a doubt, the best nourishment."
"As Huang Xiaolong continued to refine the dragon essence, the black and blue dragon martial spirits reaped great benefits, growing stronger and more powerful."
"The surging dragon might that filled the hall belonged to Huang Xiaolong himself, and not the black and blue twin dragon martial spirits."
"Huang Xiaolong wasted no time in summoning the Eminent Holiness Halberd and both black and blue dragon martial spirits, instantly soul transforming."
"Li Qiuping and the rest watched with jaws agape the scene before them, especially the dazzling black and blue dragons winding around Huang Xiaolong."
"While everyone was still in shock, coruscating lights of black and blue flickered, Huang Xiaolong soul transformed in an instant with the twin dragons martial spirit."
"Gleaming black and blue dragon scales covered Huang Xiaolong’s body, sharp nasty bone spikes lined the length of his arms."
"If it weren’t for his strong willpower and passable spiritual force, with both black and blue dragons protecting his soul, he would have lost himself in the pain, dying in the process."
"The black and blue twin dragons followed, roaring endlessly."
"He possessed the twin black and blue dragon martial spirits, and he had absorbed an Earth Dragon egg."
"While flying, Huang Xiaolong tried to sense the reaction of the black and blue martial spirits inside him, but the lack of any reaction from them since he entered the Origin Forest disappointed him."
"On this day, Huang Xiaolong’s group stopped to rest on a mountain peak, when suddenly the black and blue dragon martial spirits in Huang Xiaolong’s body shook."
"Sensing the black and blue dragon martial spirits’ reaction inside his body, Huang Xiaolong’s heart leaped with joy!"
"At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s group was flying at high speed across the Dragon City, trying sense any unique energy fluctuations of  the Dragon Clan’s treasures, however, ever since they entered the Ancient Dragon Clan’s ruins, the black and blue dragon martial spirits in Huang Xiaolong’s body quieted once more, as if they were suppressed by something."
"Just when he flew past a square, suddenly, the black and blue twin dragon martial spirits inside his body stirred, almost violently."
"On the surface, one couldn’t tell if there was anything unique about this place, but the strong reaction of the black and blue dragons inside his body couldn’t be mistaken."
"At this point, the black and blue dragon martial spirits inside Huang Xiaolong stirred, flying out of Huang Xiaolong’s body, hovering above the Dragon Pearl."
"Influenced by the black and blue dragon’s atmosphere, the Dragon Pearl’s brightness increased, issuing long humming noises, and actually flew towards the black and blue dragons, circling the air together."
"While the Dragon Pearl flew around the black and blue dragons, Huang Xiaolong noticed the dragon scales on both of them becoming shinier, the horn on their head grew longer, and the dragon might emitted from them became stronger."
"He watched as the black and blue dragons flew back towards him and the Dragon Pearl followed, stopping in front of Huang Xiaolong."
"Seconds before he exploded, the black and blue dragon flew out from his body, roaring skyward, intertwining with the Dragon Pearl."
"The black and blue dragon martial spirits hovered above him, absorbing the true dragon essence that lingered in the Xumi Temple, in the last two years, the black and blue dragons had grown to a length of two hundred zhang, their body thickness had more than doubled."
"Fortunately, the black and blue dragon martial spirits guarded the Dragon Pearl at that time."
"Before the crowd’s shocked eyes, Asura qi surged from Huang Xiaolong’s body, piercing the sky, both black and blue dragons flew out from his body, overwhelming the four directions of the Blessed Buddha City with overpowering dragon might."
"Surprise, shock, and excitement flickered passed the crowd as they stared in adoration at the black and blue dragons hovering above Huang Xiaolong’s head."
"The black and blue twin dragons were like two majestic divine mountains as they hovered in the sky, the dragon might radiating from their bodies seemed to envelop everything under the heavens in an oppressive pressure."
Chen Chen and the two Grand Elders were confounded as they stared wide-eyed at the black and blue twin dragons above Huang Xiaolong.
"The black and blue twin dragons hovered above Huang Xiaolong’s head, emitting brilliant halos of black and blue."
"In the next moment, the black and blue twin dragons flew out and he instantly soul transformed."
"Looking at the black and blue dragon martial spirits high above, everybody almost shivered simultaneously."
"In that short span of time, Huang Xiaolong had soul transformed, fusing with both black and blue twin dragon martial spirits."
"At the same time, the black and blue twin dragons materialized, shaking the heavens with their roars."
The crowd was genuinely shocked watching Huang Xiaolong summon the black and blue twin dragons.
"At the same time, Huang Xiaolong summoned the black and blue twin dragons, but he did not soul transformed, instead he sent the twin dragons into the midst of Deities Templar’s experts with a casual wave of his hand."
"The black and blue twin dragons weaved their bodies through the group of experts, pulverizing more than a dozen people into mincemeat."
"If he soul transformed with both the black and blue dragon, he was confident in defeating Li Lu."
A tattoo-like image of the black and blue dragon heads appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s back.
"At the same time, the black and blue twin dragon martial spirits flew out from his body."
"In the inner part of the mountain, Huang Xiaolong let out a shout, both black and blue twin dragons flew out, enhancing Huang Xiaolong’s strength."
"The black and blue twin dragons hovered above him, their dragon roars echoed in the air."
"Not wasting a second, he immediately soul transformed, integrating with the black and blue twin dragon martial spirits."
"At the same time, he summoned both the black and blue twin martial spirits and soul transformed."
"Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded in a golden light, his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits circled around him."
Both the black and blue twin dragon martial spirits hovered above his head.
"He summoned his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits, soul transformed, and then further transformed into his Asura Physique, pushing the frigid Asura Qi inside his body to the limit."
"The black and blue dragon heads were like a tattoo on his back, exuding majestic dragon might."
"Watching Huang Hongtian revert to his phoenix form, Huang Xiaolong summoned his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits and soul transformed."
"Huang Xiaolong dared not be careless, summoning his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits, soul transforming and stimulating the true immortal essence force from his dantian with all effort."
"At the same time, the black and blue dragons flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, their roars echoing throughout the gray space."
"Inside the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded in layers of blood mist, the black and blue twin dragons flickering behind him."
"Apart from the black and blue twin dragons, the Back Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires spirits also hovered around him, absorbing the blood essence energy that floated out from Huang Xiaolong’s body."
The black and blue twin dragons flew back into his body together with the two divine fire spirits.
"At this exact moment, within his soul sea, brilliant dazzling light burst out, the black and blue twin dragons’ roars reverberated in his mind."
The black and blue twin dragon martial spirits flew out and Huang Xiaolong instantly soul transformed.
"After the three divine fires emerged, Huang Xiaolong summoned his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits and soul transformed."
"Huang Xiaolong then noticed that his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits also disappeared, becoming one with his soul."
This blue dragon was the result of the merging of the initial black and blue twin dragon martial spirits.
"The robe burst into fragments, revealing his muscular torso and the black and blue dragon heads on his back, emitting a faint demonic aura."
"Even though Cao Feng had been looked over, her face was still black and blue, there were also the two fallen front teeth that couldn’t be regrown."
The ethereal images of his black and blue twin dragons hovered behind him.
"Moreover, he was born with the black and blue twin dragons martial spirit and had integrated with a dragon pearl while he was still in the lower realm."
"On his back, black and blue twin dragons appeared, emitting pulses of dragon might."
"When only one day was remaining before their arrival to the Clear Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong was bathed in a dazzling light, while dragon roars reverberated in space as the black and blue dragon flew out from his body."
Traces of black and blue lingered in the gas as it dissipated around his body.
"Flipping his palm, the wooden cane that had beaten Lun Zhuan black and blue appeared in his hand."
He’s going to come back beaten black and blue”.
One could simply not look straight at this scene of him being beaten black and blue!
"Everyone is fighting over that position till they’re black and blue, yet you gave it up just because of her."
"He had been beaten black and blue, and several bones in his body were broken."
"Senior Brother Jin is challenging the seventh idol today, and he gets beat up black and blue every time, haha."
"If they continued getting punched, they would end up black and blue."
The other seven were lying on the ground in pain; all of them were beaten black and blue.
"So when a person first entered the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, it was not at all rare to see people with their faces black and blue."
"There was no skill to this brawl, and they were quickly bruised black and blue."
"Today, I’ll beat you black and blue”."
"Next time, if anyone makes things hard on you, just tell me and I’ll make sure to beat them black and blue."
"You were all unrivaled, while I’m beaten black and blue."
"If we still didn’t hit back after you’ve repeatedly provoked us, we’d be beaten black and blue by you, wouldn’t we?"
"But it wasn’t more than a few days before someone beat him black and blue, and he came crying to Long Chen."
"""This better be urgent, pal, because otherwise I'm going to paint you black and blue all over""."
Tista and Phloria were still black and blue from their last sparring sessions.
Even her face was black and blue.
"Soon, Kai Yang was going to be beaten black and blue."
He waved his hands hitting Long Jun till he was black and blue.
Every time would end with him being beaten black and blue.
"His clothes were ripped to shreds, and his body was beaten black and blue and covered all over in fresh blood."
"Gripping her fist, her silk threads viciously contracted and instantly dismembered the two already black and blue Immortal Ascension Boundary First Stage cultivators."
All of them had many black and blue bruises and some even had broken bones.
"” Kuang Shi, who had been knocked into the ground, leaped up and shouted anxiously, his face beaten black and blue yet not daring to show the slightest hint of dissatisfaction."
"If you dare move a single step from that spot, I swear I’ll chase you to the ends of the world and punch you black and blue!"
"“No wonder you were tied up and beaten black and blue, your special treatment was a result of your special status,” Yang Kai laughed."
"He didn’t take away the Saint Crystal held by Shen Tu, as if he was tacitly approving of him owning it; however, the price Shen Tu had paid for this piece of Saint Crystal was high, Ke Meng had beaten him black and blue, breaking his nose and causing blood to spill from his mouth."
"” Yang Kai smiled lightly and glanced over at Hai Zhen whose face was black and blue, swollen all over, “Your Excellency, why not just ask your disciple to explain?"
Anyone who resisted was punched black and blue.
"After only three breaths, Pang Zhen and the others were beaten black and blue."
"The next moment, Yang Kai sat cross-legged as his face turned black and blue alternatively."
Just watch how your Senior Brother beats him black and blue to the point that his wives would not recognize him!
"Perhaps because he was afraid of getting beaten black and blue like he just was, when he saw Yang Kai again, he decisively summoned this Emperor Authority Bead."
"Even though his rivals were all Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators as well, they were clearly not this man’s opponent and were being beaten black and blue."
"Yang Kai flashed a mocking smile as he quipped, “Feng Xi also said this before, but he was beaten black and blue by this Young Master."
"If Yang Kai came to know of this, he would surely beat them black and blue."
"While beating him black and blue, he stated, “If you dare to speak more nonsense, I will tear you into ten thousand pieces”."
"Within a short time, Wu Ming was beaten black and blue with a bruised nose and swollen face."
"Instead, Li Xuan was beaten black and blue by Yang Kai."
"” Yang Kai grabbed him by the collar and hoisted him up, glaring fiercely at his face, “You think I won’t beat you black and blue for that?"
"When you’re back, your mother will probably beat you black and blue."
"If anybody dared to act so presumptuously in my house, I would have beaten them black and blue until even their mother couldn’t recognise them!"
"” Zhu Yan was bristling with anger, wishing he could vent his anger by beating Yang Kai black and blue before continuing this talk."
This Demon Race Army was indeed the very same army that had been beaten black and blue last time.

black out
------------------------------------
"In an instant, chaotic energy filled the surroundings, causing Huang Xiaolong to black out."
He then felt excruciating pain shot through his acromion the moment the cane landed on him; it was enough to make him black out.
"It was pitch-black outside with not a star in sight, save for a moon, which was gradually getting obscured by the gloomy clouds."
"After entering the bedroom, Yun Na removed her black outfit and sat on the bed."
"Lu Bosheng and his wife, who was being supported physically by another person, were in plain black outfits."
Yun Shishi turned her head sharply and saw that the woman was dressed in a simple ink black outfit.
"Tianming felt his vision black out from the pain, though the feeling disappeared after he took a deep breath."
"I'm not Ajatar, one more word and I'll beat you so hard that you'll black out until our second lesson""."
"Yang Kai was in no position to care about others for now because if he did not focus on maintaining his consciousness, he would black out."
"It was pitch black outside of room one, as if the entire room had sunken into The Void."
"The guests were indifferent, but Mama Song, who greeted the guests at the door, was infuriated and yelled at a certain man, who wore a black outfit, on the second floor, “Waste!"

shoot from the hip

an arm and a leg
------------------------------------
"At this time, the Elder that returned blood-stained from Sky Magi Sect opened his mouth after slight hesitation, “Sovereign, Chen Xiaotian also told me to bring you a message, he said, tomorrow he would cut off one of Young Lord’s arms, the day after tomorrow an arm and a leg, and on the third day, he would cripple Young Lord’s remaining leg!"
"Although a residence in Aeon City would cost an arm and a leg twice over, what Huang Xiaolong did not lack most of all was money."
"“Unfortunately, the wine costs an arm and a leg”."
Many would willingly give an arm and a leg to be his assistant just to get close to him.
An average meal of two or three dishes in the restaurant would cost an arm and a leg to the typical rich.
Most of which cost an arm and a leg.
"With the restaurant costing an arm and a leg to build, it was only natural that the price of the food served would not come cheap."
They would have given an arm and a leg to have one more trick in their arsenal or one more member in their group.
There are plenty enough of my children that would pay an arm and a leg to attend.
"The next moment, the old swindler took a step forward and, in a flash, arrived a few kilometres away before squatting down and looking at an Origin King who had lost an arm and a leg in the previous battle."
------------------------------------
not your cup of tea
------------------------------------
"Even if you have all the money in the world, you can’t have the life you want, and you feel that the life you’re living is not your cup of tea."
------------------------------------
in the same boat
------------------------------------
"“However, I hope that you will understand that I, Chu Feng, have brought you all here because we stand in the same boat."
"We are in the same boat, through joy and happiness, trials and tribulations, from here on, so don’t treat me as an outsider”."
"However, the two of them were in the same boat and making use of each other now."
"Now that they were in the same boat, it was like being stuck in the same pair of pants."
"Now we’re in the same boat, are you really happy to see me suffering?"
"Right now, we are still ants in the same boat."
"""Our divine realms are all currently in the same boat."
"Now, we’re in the same boat for survival."
"We’re now in the same boat, so that makes us friends, right""?"
"After all, they were in the same boat, so exposing Tianming wouldn't do it any good."
"We're in the same boat, so we'll be looking out for one another""."
"Now, they were in the same boat."
"""Here and now, we’re in the same boat, right?"
"As long as we’re in the same boat, everything will be fine."
"Even if we don't particularly like them, we’re now in the same boat as them."
"We’re in the same boat now, alive or dead""."
"They were all in the same boat, after all."
"I’m in the same boat…… Even if she didn’t go out of control, I had expected that she would try to forcibly stay…… but she didn’t even complain."
We’re in the same boat.
"We are in the same boat, both at work and for the pinch our loved ones are into."
"As for immortality, you and I are in the same boat."
Kwart was in the same boat.
“We’re both in the same boat”.
Now he had no thoughts of finding trouble with Yang Kai because he was in the same boat.
"They were already in the same boat with Yang Kai and were already the High Ranking Foreign Elders of High Heaven Palace, but if they gave Yang Kai too much pressure and seemed to be too eager for quick benefits, Yang Kai might be displeased with them."
"Yang Kai sighed, “Anyway, you and Gong Yue are in the same boat."
We are all in the same boat.
"High Heaven Palace, Ice Heart Valley, and Fire Dragon Palace were in the same boat, advancing and retreating together, so if Yang Kai really wanted to unify the whole Northern Territory, these two Sects would not stand in his way."
"Fortunately, Fire Dragon Palace was in the same boat; otherwise, he would have been at a loss for what to do."
