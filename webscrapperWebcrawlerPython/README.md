## Idiom Sentence Collection

Folder contains several scripts used to gather links, scrape text from them, separate it into sentences and then filter those sentences that contain idioms from a pre-defines list.

To start using the scripts do the following:

- Navigate to the main folder
- Install all required dependencies by running this command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the scripts in the folder. Example:

```python
python .\webcraweler.py
```

Each script is documented and explains its own usage via top-level comment.
