"Li Qiye glanced over at Ancient Pine and smiled: “Demon Monarch can be frank with me, there is no need to beat around the bush”."

"Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted her: “Speak if you will and fart if you must, do not beat around the bush with me."

"This was a living being with flesh and blood."
"They wanted to survive, so it could even be said that outside of not having physical flesh and blood, the sentiments were no different from their outside counterparts."
"He heavily struck the ground due to the kick and turned into a puddle of flesh and blood, staining the ground."
"However, this made sense because the prince was indeed her own flesh and blood."
"The truth was that they weren’t ghosts, they were existences with flesh and blood."
"His massacre painted a grisly picture as flesh and blood spattered all over his canvas."
"It was as if myriad hands made from flesh and blood were on his back."
"Heaven Outcast and Qin Guangwang fought as their flesh and blood flew everywhere."
"Those who had part of their bodies made out of flesh and blood were powerful golems or were mixed-race offspring."
"Those who were completely made of flesh and blood were even rarer, and they were definitely offspring from powerful bloodlines."
"Of course, some golems required a long time to gain a higher degree of intelligence to the point where they transformed to have flesh and blood — a sign of their strength."
"When a golem reached a particular power level to have flesh and blood, they were able to reproduce."
"Progenies were usually born with flesh and blood and also inherited the golem race’s powerful strength."
"Mixed-bloods had flesh and blood, but they lost the natural advantages of golems, such as their innate strength."
"There was a chance that they might die before reaching a flesh and blood form."
"In this lively city, meeting a human or a demon or golem in full human form that had full flesh and blood bodies was very difficult since very few experts walked by this place."
"A body of flesh and blood without visible blood energy or cultivation — only a human could have these characteristics."
"To be born with a complete flesh and blood body… Perhaps her ancestor was an extremely heaven-defying existence, maybe even an Immortal Emperor."
"” He was a golem with a body made out of flesh and blood, but his eyes were a golden color."
"He was a golem with an indescribable noble background and a flesh and blood body at birth."
"Some golems kept their rocky bodies while there were also those who had complete flesh and blood bodies."
"In a flash, all the separated flesh and blood that was splashing everywhere receded back in place like a tide at an unbelievable speed and went back to Li Qiye’s body."
"Deep bloody holes appeared on his body as flesh and blood spattered about."
"In just a moment, the wounds and spattered flesh and blood were infused by a gray shade and receded like a tide back to its original location."
"” Oh how she wished to taste Li Qiye’s flesh and blood due to this burning hatred."
"At the moment of its inception, it immediately had flesh and blood and could be considered supreme!"
"Suddenly, loud screams came from everywhere as flesh and blood spattered in the sky."
"Li Qiye gently patted the skeletal phoenix and felt the pumping heart: “I can refine it and eventually put its body together then use the heart so that it can rebuild its flesh and blood”."
"He paused for a moment and narrowed his eyes: “However, in order to rebuild its flesh and blood and fill it with divinity… this step requires the essence under the Alchemy Vein”."
"The madam asked: “After reinforcing its flesh and blood, would the phoenix be reborn?"
"Li Qiye shook his head: “No, in this process, its flesh and blood is not the most important thing."
"“If we can create its flesh and blood, then the Phoenix will have a chance for rebirth”."
"It was no longer only a skeleton but had flesh and blood."
"He repaired its skeleton, gave it flesh and blood, and also granted it intelligence."
"These ferocious beasts were formed from mud and stone instead of having flesh and blood bodies”."
"He wanted nothing more than to skin Li Qiye alive and taste his flesh and blood."
"Today, I will take my time feasting on your flesh and blood!"
"I stand before you not as an illusion, but as a living being with flesh and blood."
"Towering mountains and peaks were rebuilt from the accumulation of flesh and blood."
"” The Storm God pointed at him and snapped: “I want to strip your skin, crush you, and taste your flesh and blood!"
"No flesh and blood, or to be frank, all of you are dead, the living dead!"
"“We won’t talk about why the inhabitants of this world are able to live forever without flesh and blood because this is no secret to me”."
"The monarch had a human head with flesh and blood while the head of this corpse was made from metal."
"The reserved Bai Jianzhen asked: “After cleaning up all of these metal bodies, we noticed that they don’t have flesh and blood, so what kind of lifeforms are they?"
"However, stones and metals all had a particular characteristic after being enlightened by the dao — a physical body with flesh and blood."
"Di Wei looked at Li Qiye and spoke: “You are in an even better state with your own flesh and blood."
"The moment their flesh and blood formed, they would turn into cultivators."
"Although his body was made out of flesh and blood, his right arm still carried the characteristics of a treant for it seemed to be carved out of wood."
"Only those with a flesh and blood body could reproduce and spread their bloodline to future descendants."
"At this moment, these laws are relying on your flesh and blood to grow, that’s all”."
"Even though he was one of the greatest in history and stood on top of the tenth world, this was still his daughter, his flesh and blood!"
"We have flesh and blood, life and soul!"
"Dodging was out of the question so his chest was penetrated, flesh and blood spurted out."
"Alas, using their flesh and blood to block the way was futile."
"This aura was simply flowing within its very flesh and blood."
"On the other hand, he was truly a giant made out of flesh and blood, perhaps the largest existence in Three Immortals."
"He seemed eager to have a taste of Li Qiye’s flesh and blood."
"The monster was as big as a planet so it had plenty of flesh and blood to go."
"He underwent a monumental change, no longer possessing a physical body with flesh and blood."
"Not to mention flesh and blood, even the strongest imperial treasure couldn’t have stopped it and would just be destroyed."
"People started wondering - are those arms actually made out flesh and blood?"
"They were different from regular humans and demons, not possessing a body made out of flesh and blood."
"It didn’t have flesh and blood and despite its grotesque appearance, it was made of flame."
"Swords protruded on his metallic back, seemingly made from flesh and blood."
"The progenitor was different, made from rocks instead of flesh and blood."
"It wasn’t made out of flesh and blood but rather flowing fiery dao runes."
"Their race was the same - born with a body made of bronze instead of flesh and blood."
"Even the strongest characters in existence had a physical body, usually made from flesh and blood."
"” The remaining flesh and blood splattered away like a torrent of mud and stones."
"One wouldn’t be able to sense his flesh and blood as if he wasn’t in the same dimension."
"“If you three can kill him, I’m sure no one else will try to compete for his flesh and blood”."
"The disciples took a careful look and found that the creature wasn’t made from flesh and blood, only by pure power."
"Every inch was still made of flesh and blood, no sign of stones."
"He was a golem who still maintained a body of flesh and blood."
"He seemed to no longer be made from flesh and blood, having been turned into a golden statue with a holy aura."
"It gained more flesh and blood afterward."
"The biggest clue to this statement was the skeleton trying to devour flesh and blood."
"It was clear that his body wasn’t made from flesh and blood."
"However, the majority maintained a physical form consisting of flesh and blood."
"“The only thing on my mind is to feast on your flesh and blood then devour your true fate”."
"“It’s not like you haven’t tasted my flesh and blood before."

"With the payment done, seven old men came in the door; all covered in a black outfit from top to bottom."
"He wore a black outfit while appearing ethereal like a flickering flame on the verge of extinguishing."
"Some of them didn’t want to reveal their identity so they wore black outfits or used certain stealth methods to conceal their appearance."
